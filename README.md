Primitive tool for watching a directory and running a a command/s

Made it, as I was tired of repeating the same command everytime I updated some code, and having to find a new way of watching and running a command/s for every language.

To install, which who really is going to do that but me:

```
go install github.com/Majunga/go_watch@v0.0.3
```


And if your GOPATH is setup correctly, you can now use it anywhere... so bloody easy (and technically a finished project :O)
